Subject: copyright infringment issue  

Message Body:

I represent Samsung Telecommunications America, LLC and Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd in trademark and copyright matters. It has come to Samsung's attention that its copyright protected firmware has been leaked and posted on your web site without authorization. See, http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2369130. Samsung is especially concerned since the leaked firmware is not the final version to be released, which could be misleading to consumers.

Samsung requests that this firmware and/or links to the firmware be immediately removed from your web site.

Thank-you for your attention to this matter.

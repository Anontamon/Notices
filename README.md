XDA Legal Notices
=================

This repository includes legal notices (including DMCA takedown notices, copyright and other legal takedown letters) sent to XDA Developers.

The intention is to keep the community members of XDA up to date with reasons why a posting may have been removed. Threads which have been removed are linked to the notice which caused the removal. Notices are sorted by date received and PII has been redacted.

To challenge a takedown, please open an issue on the notice file and we will review the takedown for further action.
